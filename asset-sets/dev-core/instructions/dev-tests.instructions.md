- One behaviour per test. Name the test after the behaviour, not after the function it calls.
- Arrange, act and assert, in that order, separated by a blank line.
- No fixed waits such as `sleep` or `setTimeout`: wait for the condition the test needs.
- Load the dev-best-practices skill when a test needs new helpers or fixtures.
